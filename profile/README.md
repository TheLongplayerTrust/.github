**[Longplayer](https://longplayer.org/) in Numbers**

One cycle: **1000** years / **365,243** days / **8,765,832** hours / **525,949,920** minutes 

Longplayer is composed by the action of an algorithm on **6** pieces of musical material, the source music, each **20** minutes **20** seconds long. 

Each piece of source music is made from **39** singing bowls and periods of silence = **234** singing bowls.

All the pieces of source music are identical save for their tunings, each being transpositions of one another. The transpositions are  **-12** semitones, **-7** semitones, **-5** semitones , **0** semitones, **+5** semitones, **+7** semitones. 

Longplayer’s algorithm updates the start point of each piece of the source music, the point from which it will play for the next **2** minutes, every **2** minutes: **262,974,960** times over **1000** years, **1,577,849,760** instructions in all (for all **6** pieces of source music). 

The increments, the amounts each start point moves on every **2** minutes, from lowest transposition to highest, are **0.058802176451** seconds, **0.25274497619048** seconds, **0.001053103** seconds, **0.000004639** seconds, **0.44787077823129** seconds and **0.0074645129705216** seconds.  

The pieces of source music are circular, where their beginning (**0** minutes **0** seconds) and end (**20** minutes **20** seconds) are the same point. Represented as **6** concentric circles the innermost is the highest transposition, moving progressively lower towards the outermost which is the lowest. 

Because of the circularity the increments can also be expressed as angles. As the pieces of source music are **20** minutes **20** seconds long one second is equivalent to **0.295081967213115** degrees (**360** / **1220**). 

The increments, expressed as angles, from lowest transposition to highest are **0.017351461903574O°**, **0.074580484777519°**, **0.000310751704918°**, **0.000001368885246°**, **0.132158590297758°** and **0.002202643171629°**. 

At the beginning of Longplayer all start points are at **0** seconds, as they will be every **1000** years. 

The successive increments to each start point cause them to move around the pieces of source music, each at a different rate determined by their value. The lengths of time it takes each start point to move once around the source music, **360** degrees, from **0** seconds to **20** minutes **20** seconds are, from lowest transposition to highest: **28.8160158** days, **6.70416667** days, **1609** days, **365243** days, **3.783294144456759** days and **227** days.

<small>Score on 23rd March 2024 at 12.06 GMT: yellow sections represent the 2 minute sections playing at that time. This combination will not occur again until 23rd March 2024.</small>


The number of times each start point travels **360** degrees around the source music, in one **1000** year cycle, is, from lowest transposition to highest: **12,675** times, **54,480** times, **227** times, **1** time, **96,541** times and **1609** times.
